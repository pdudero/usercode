The signal model has no nuisance parameters. Please run the limit tool with no systematics (option -S 0).
To make things easier, I will assume you have done it.

Computing limit starting from observation

 -- Asymptotic -- 
Observed Limit: r < 4.5238
Expected  2.5%: r < 1.2209
Expected 16.0%: r < 1.6240
Expected 50.0%: r < 2.2503
Expected 84.0%: r < 3.1257
Expected 97.5%: r < 4.1529
