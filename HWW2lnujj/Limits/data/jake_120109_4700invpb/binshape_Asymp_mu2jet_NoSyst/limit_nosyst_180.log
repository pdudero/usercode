The signal model has no nuisance parameters. Please run the limit tool with no systematics (option -S 0).
To make things easier, I will assume you have done it.

Computing limit starting from observation

 -- Asymptotic -- 
Observed Limit: r < 1.3365
Expected  2.5%: r < 0.8510
Expected 16.0%: r < 1.1319
Expected 50.0%: r < 1.5685
Expected 84.0%: r < 2.1787
Expected 97.5%: r < 2.8946
