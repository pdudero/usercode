The signal model has no nuisance parameters. Please run the limit tool with no systematics (option -S 0).
To make things easier, I will assume you have done it.

Computing limit starting from observation

 -- Asymptotic -- 
Observed Limit: r < 2.2463
Expected  2.5%: r < 0.9828
Expected 16.0%: r < 1.3073
Expected 50.0%: r < 1.8115
Expected 84.0%: r < 2.5162
Expected 97.5%: r < 3.3431
