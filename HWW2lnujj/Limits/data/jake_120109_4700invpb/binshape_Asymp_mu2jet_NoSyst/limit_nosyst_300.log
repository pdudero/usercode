The signal model has no nuisance parameters. Please run the limit tool with no systematics (option -S 0).
To make things easier, I will assume you have done it.

Computing limit starting from observation

 -- Asymptotic -- 
Observed Limit: r < 1.5784
Expected  2.5%: r < 0.7003
Expected 16.0%: r < 0.9315
Expected 50.0%: r < 1.2907
Expected 84.0%: r < 1.7928
Expected 97.5%: r < 2.3820
