The signal model has no nuisance parameters. Please run the limit tool with no systematics (option -S 0).
To make things easier, I will assume you have done it.

Computing limit starting from observation

 -- Asymptotic -- 
Observed Limit: r < 5.6210
Expected  2.5%: r < 0.9284
Expected 16.0%: r < 1.2349
Expected 50.0%: r < 1.7112
Expected 84.0%: r < 2.3769
Expected 97.5%: r < 3.1580
